A short report (10 pages maximum) outlining how the team approached the delivery of the assignment and lessons learned. Screenshots of relevant MS Teams conversations, GitHub project board, issues or pull requests should be included in the main body of the report or appendix. Material within the appendices is considered supplementary and as a result may or may not be read by the marker. The appendices do not contribute to the overall report page count.
